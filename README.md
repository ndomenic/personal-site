# personal-site

This is the repository for my personal website, available at [domenichini.ca](https://www.domenichini.ca/). It was built in [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/), and making use of the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) UI framework for various components used through the site. It also makes use of a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server configured to use [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve as the backend, which serves the static files and provides individual links for the pdf and image files hosted on the site. 

The website is hosted on my personal server, and all requests are proxied through my [reverse proxy server](https://github.com/ndomenic/reverse-proxy-server), which allows this site and other applications to run on the same domain.
